📊 Hugging Face Hub Model Analysis
🔍 Overview
This project analyzes Hugging Face Hub model metadata using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning to understand what factors influence model popularity, downloads, and community engagement.


🎯 Objectives

* Explore trends in model downloads, likes, and update frequency

* Identify relationships between model age, updates, and popularity

* Use machine learning to evaluate key factors affecting engagement


📂 Dataset

* Source: Hugging Face Hub metadata

* Features include model downloads, likes, creation date, and last update date


🛠 Tech Stack

* Language: Python

* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

* Environment: Jupyter Notebook


🔬 Workflow

* Cleaned and preprocessed metadata (missing values, date features)

* Performed EDA with statistical analysis and visualizations

* Engineered features such as model age and update recency

* Built and evaluated Linear Regression, ElasticNet, and Random Forest models

📈 Key Insights

* Recently updated models tend to have higher engagement

* Model age and update frequency significantly impact popularity

* Random Forest provided better insight into feature importance
